        "1. Identify and explore transactions (money transfers) between first-party fraudsters and other clients\n",
        "2. Use Weakly Connected Components (WCC) to reveal transaction networks linked to known fraudsters\n",
        "3. Use PageRank (centrality) to score clients based on their influence in terms of the amount of money transferred to/from fraudsters and assign risk score to these clients\n",
        "\n",
        "While identifying and blocking fraudulent accounts is valuable, the real power of graph analytics lies in the ability to continuously expand the investigation across transactions, entities, and behaviours as new data becomes available.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have suspected fraudulent accounts(*first party*) identified, what can we learn from any transaction activity they have been able to perform. There must be a way for members to profit from these accounts and looking deeper as connections between the groups might lead us to central players in a larger fraud operation."

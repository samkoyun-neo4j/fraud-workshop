        "3. Use PageRank (centrality) to score clients based on their influence in terms of the amount of money transferred to/from fraudsters and assign risk score to these clients\n",

        "Now that we have suspected fraudulent accounts(*first party*) identified, what can we learn from any transaction activity they have been able to perform. There must be a way for members to profit from these accounts and looking deeper as connections between the groups might lead us to central players in a larger fraud operation."

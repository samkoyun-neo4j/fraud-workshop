        "# Discovering second party fraud\n",

        "According to FBI, criminals recruit money mules to help launder proceeds derived from online scams and frauds. Money mules add layers of distance between victims and fraudsters, which makes it harder for law enforcement to accurately trace money trails.\n",

        "In this exercise, we detect money mules in the paysim dataset. Our hypothesis is that clients who transfer money to/from first party fraudsters are suspects for second party fraud.\n",

        "1. Identify and explore transactions (money transfers) between first-party fraudsters and other clients\n",
        "2. Use WCC (community detection) to identify networks of clients who are connected to first party fraudsters (Second-party fraud network)\n",
        "3. Use PageRank (centrality) to score clients based on their influence in terms of the amount of money transferred to/from fraudsters and assign risk score (secondPartyFraudScore) to these clients\n",

        "## Exploring the connections via transactions\n",
        "\n",
        "While finding, identifying and removing fraudulent accounts is a great use case for graph analytics, the real power comes from being able to dig deeper and further into connections using multiple datasets assembled into a powerful representation of connections in your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have suspected fraudulent accounts(*first party*) identified, what can we learn from any transaction activity they have been able to perform. There must be a way for members to profit from these accounts and looking deeper as connections between the groups might lead us to central players in a larger fraud operation."
